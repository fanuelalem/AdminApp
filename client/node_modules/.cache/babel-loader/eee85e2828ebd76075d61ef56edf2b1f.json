For example, a\n * common pattern is to serialize just the user ID into the session (due to the\n * fact that it is desirable to store the minimum amount of data in a session).\n * When a subsequent request arrives for the session, the full User object can\n * be loaded from the database by ID.\n *\n * Note that additional middleware is required to persist login state, so we\n * must use the `connect.session()` middleware _before_ `passport.initialize()`.\n *\n * If sessions are being used, this middleware must be in use by the\n * Connect/Express application for Passport to operate.  If the application is\n * entirely stateless (not using sessions), this middleware is not necessary,\n * but its use will not have any adverse impact.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n *     app.use(connect.cookieParser());\n *     app.use(connect.session({ secret: 'keyboard cat' }));\n *     app.use(passport.initialize());\n *     app.use(passport.session());\n *\n *     passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {\n *       done(null, user.id);\n *     });\n *\n *     passport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) {\n *       User.findById(id, function (err, user) {\n *         done(err, user);\n *       });\n *     });\n *\n * @return {Function}\n * @api public\n */\nmodule.exports = function initialize(passport) {\n  return function initialize(req, res, next) {\n    req._passport = {};\n    req._passport.instance = passport;\n\n    if (req.session && req.session[passport._key]) {\n      // load data from existing session\n      req._passport.session = req.session[passport._key];\n    }\n\n    next();\n  };\n};","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
